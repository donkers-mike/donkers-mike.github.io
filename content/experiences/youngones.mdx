###### Reason for leaving
--- 
For reasons that are, to this day, not completely clear to me, YoungOnes decided
not to prolong my contract (which was a 7-month contract).

I have since accepted that I probably won't ever know exactly why they decided
on this and to be completely honest, I don't really care anymore either.

---
###### My responsibilities
---
Within YoungOnes my responsibilities were focused on the B2B side of the
platform, which is the side where the "jobs" are posted by companies in need of
extra help. In this platform I was one of the developers responsible for
building new features, maintaining existing features and providing support where
needed.
