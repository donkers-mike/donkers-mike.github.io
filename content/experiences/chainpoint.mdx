###### Reason for leaving
--- 
When I applied for the position at ChainPoint, it was all about JavaScript, the
job listing was all about it, the interviews were completely focused on it, even
when I initially started working there, it's all I did. This however took a
complete 180 degree turn when I delivered my plan to migrate their .NET codebase
to React (as I talk about [here](/projects/dotnet-to-react)).
<br/>
Upon presenting this plan, which was well-received, I got the news that while
the plan was good, it'd not be started within the next ~2 years and until then,
I'd be working within their .NET codebase. 
<br/>
This took me by surprise, since as I mentioned before, everything regarding the
position was surrounding JavaScript, but after voicing my disagreement, I
accepted the facts and continued my work for ChainPoint.
<br/>
Then in December of 2020, I suffered a collapsed lung and spent a little under 2
weeks in the hospital, during which, I was in contact with my then supervisor to
give status updates. I however did not go back to work until a while after said
incident. My going back to work started slow, since I was still recovering from
what had happened. After a bit of time I kept getting asked to pick work up
more, that I had to come into the office (which I didn't since I was recovering
from a collapsed lung and it was the height of COVID).
<br/>
The company's actions to me felt like they were inconsiderate of my situation
and this lead to me taking a step back and calling in sick to be able to properly
give my body time to recover. Eventually ending up at a occupational health
doctor who would see if I could go back to work. They "sided" with me and told
the company that I indeed, given all the circumstances, was not able to carry
out my duties as they expected. We (said doctor and myself) did propose a
different structure, this however was not acceptable for the company, leading to
them terminating my contract.

###### My responsibilities
---
Within ChainPoint my responsibilities started out as making a plan to migrate
their existing .NET codebase to a headless React frontend (read more about this
[here](/projects/dotnet-to-react)
<br/>

After this plan was set-up, presented and well-received, I was however tasked
with working in their existing .NET codebase (read more
at my [reason for leaving](#reason-for-leaving))
<br />
All-in-all my responsibilities were designing, maintaining, expanding and fixing features
and implementations in the frontend of the platform. To do this I used .NET
(since that's what the codebase consisted of), JavaScript, CSS and HTML
