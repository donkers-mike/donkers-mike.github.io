###### Reason for leaving
--- 
When I joined WeProvide, I had just recovered (mostly) from a collapsed lung I
had in December of 2020. This did however still make it difficult for me to do a lot of things I
normally wouldn't think twice about, i.e. going into the office.

This initially wasn't an issue since the Netherlands was heavily steering
towards permanently working from home. This however did become an issue when the
government did allow offices to be open for workers and WeProvide also told said
workers they had to be in office.

I went against this reasoning that due to my situation with my lung, I did not
feel comfortable nor safe being in the office, no matter the precautions.
Looking back on how I handled that whole situation, I could've and should've
done it differently, my choice of words in those moments was completely wrong
and I think that if I had communicated differently, it would've gone much
better.

All-in-all I do believe that the above played a part in why my contract with
WeProvide was not prolonged after the 1-year contract ran out.

###### My responsibilities
---
Within WeProvide my responsibilities were present in both Magento 2 as well as
React. We had multiple projects that were ongoing and even some new projects
for which, Magento was the best choice.

My biggest responsibility in React within WeProvide is documented
[here](/projects/stultiens).

Besides the above I've worked as one of the few (if not the only) frontend
developers for several webshops built in Magento such as;

- [CanDo](https://www.cando.eu/nl-nl/)
- [Skantrae](https://www.skantrae.com/)
