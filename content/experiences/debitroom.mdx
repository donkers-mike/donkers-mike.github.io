###### Reason for leaving
--- 
Sadly, going into 2024, my mental state took a severe turn for the worse and I
was forced to put down my work and focus on myself. At the time of writing
(early 2025), I am back at a point where I am no longer limited by this mental
state.

###### My responsibilities
---
My biggest reposibility at DebitRoom is covered [here](/projects/react-migration)

<br />
After the above was put to a stop due to it becoming too much of an overhead as well as a new developer joining the company who would join in rebuilding the platform from scratch, my responsibility changed to a more back-end focused role. This meant that I was working less with React and much more with NodeJS. Which to me, was a very educational process which gave a nice challenge.

<br />
To me, the fintech field was a completely new field, this made it so that I had
to not only learn what it means to work in fintech (especially the financial
part) but also what the differences are with "regular" websites. With this
change of perspective came a lot of lessons in a lot of different things such
as;
- Security layering
- Clarity of information
- a11y
<br/>
The latter in this list, of course, always being something that is very
paramount in software development. But when it comes to fintech, your target
group is too broad whereas if you'd make software that targets developers, you
can get away with certain "obvious" flows.

Working at DebitRoom was a very nice time, the people are wonderful and the work provided a needed challenge.
