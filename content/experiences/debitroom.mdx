###### My responsibilities

My biggest reposibility at DebitRoom is covered [here](/projects/react-migration)

<br />
After the above was put to a stop due to it becoming too much of an overhead as well as a new developer joining the company who would join in rebuilding the platform from scratch, my responsibility changed to a more back-end focused role. This meant that I was working less with React and much more with NodeJS. Which to me, was a very educational process which gave a nice challenge.

<br />
Sadly, literally going into 2024, my mental state took a severe turn for the worse and I was forced to put down my work and focus on myself. If you want to read on about that particular subject, see [this post](/blog/starting-2024-with-a-burnout)
<br />
Working at DebitRoom was a very nice time, the people are wonderful and the work provided a needed challenge.
