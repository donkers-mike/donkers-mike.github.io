### Tech stack:
___
######  <IconBrandReact /> [React](https://react.dev/)
Used for the front-end of a major project 
######  <Image width="20" height="20" src="/magento-2-logo.svg" alt="magento 2 logo" /> [Magento](https://business.adobe.com/nl/products/magento/magento-commerce.html)
Used as the main framework the ecommerce sites were built on, as well as used as
only a source for data / order handling.
######  <IconBrandNodejs /> [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
NodeJS was used as a layer between the React front-end and the data sources to prevent React from needing to know exactly what to get where.
###### <IconBrandGraphql /> [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
We used GraphQL in our React projects to allow our developers to only request what they need as well as to move more towards reusable and extensible queries.
###### <IconBrandSass /> [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
SCSS was our preprocessor of choice within this company and thus also the preprocessor for this project.
###### <IconBrandVue /> [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
Vue was used in one of our projects as an application injected into Magento

###### Reason for leaving
--- 
Proud Nerds, and specfically the department I was part of (Magento department)
came to be from a merger with the Magento department from
[RIFF](https://riffonline.com/) which in turn also was a result of a merger with
Jaagers, a e-commerce company which was based in Nijmegen. 

This merger came to be after (while the department was in hands of [RIFF](https://riffonline.com/)), the market dried up, the
department was bleeding money and there was no end in sight. This lead to the
department being merged into Proud Nerds, which, if I'm honest, did not go
smoothly. We were told A but reality was B in some cases (i.e. how we did things
would stay the way they were). A lot of chaos was going on in this merge which,
to me, was not pleasant.

<br/>
I eventually left Proud Nerds due to my contract with them not being prolonged,
I was on my third temporary contract and was due to get a permanent position.
However, due to the market at the time being quite dry and leads not coming in
as hoped, there wasn't a big enough workload to warrant my employment.
<br/>
Aside from that, at the time I was also still very new to the market and did not
have the proper communication skills. I was too blunt, too disrespectful and too
stubborn. Which only worked against me. I have since learned a lot about how to
act, communicate and portray myself on the market and have grown miles beyond
how I was at that time. 
<br/>
But it is as they say, hindsight is a beautiful thing, at the time it was
another reason for the company not to prolong my contract together with the
reasoning I mention in the first paragraph.

###### My responsibilities
---
When I started at [RIFF](https://riffonline.com/) (which later became Proud
Nerds) I was still in college, it was my final internship before graduating.
Once I did graduate, I stuck around at the company as a junior frontend
developer in Magento. 

Within this role I was responsible for building new, maintaining current and
fixing bugged features within several different Magento projects. 
<br />
One of the projects where I had the biggest role in would be
[UwCartridgeWinkel](/projects/ucw). 
<br />
Another project which I am very content with how it turned out is a
"storelocator" for the VVV, which is a company in the Netherlands that (among
other things) provides one of the (if not **the**) most versatile giftcards in
the country. You can see the feature
[here](https://www.vvvcadeaukaarten.nl/besteden/)

In this project, we had injected a VueJS application into Magento as a
replacement of Magento's page. This allowed us to utilize VueJS' strengths to
provide a fast, modular and independent application within Magento. (read more
about this project [here](/projects/vvv-storelocator))

<br />
This was a complete migration from Magento 1 to Magento 2 for a webshop in the Netherlands that deals in products focused on
printing. (i.e. Ink Cartridges, Paper, office supplies, etc..)
<br />
After the department became Proud Nerds, my responsibilities expanded to include
React, with the goal to make that my sole responsibility. This is also where one
of my biggest responsibilities within Proud Nerds came to be, details of which
can be found [here](/projects/crownstudent)
