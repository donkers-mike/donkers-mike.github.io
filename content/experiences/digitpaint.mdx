###### Summary
---
- Working with a very broad tech stack & migrating this to a React
frontend with a NodeJS backend architecture.
- In my role as lead developer made choices for, designed and
implemented key systems within the architecture.
- Short lines with customers to best translate their wishes into use
cases.

###### Reason for leaving
--- 
At the time I was working at Digitpaint the workload became less and less, which
was felt throughout the company. I personally did not have the feeling that this
was going to recover in a timely manner, which was one of the reasons I took my
leave. 

Besides the above, I had several moments of disagreements with the owner of the
company which were not resolved in a manner which I could handle to a point
where it wouldn't affect my views. This was also partly my own fault, due to how
I handled those types of situations at that time.

---
###### My responsibilities
---
My responsibilities at Digitpaint were mostly limited to the frontend, with a
small portion of my focus going to the backend if needed.

Within these responsibilities I had several projects going for which I either
was the de facto lead developer or one of the frontend developers.
<br />
###### Actief Leren Lezen
Actief leren lezen was a two-sided application, one which was a admin panel for
teachers, the other being a PWA for students. This project was built in React
with a custom database to store needed data. This database was a MySQL database
with TypeORM to build the queries.
<br />
###### BackLogic
BackLogic was a (in my eyes very ambitious) project to change the way we look at
our backlog. The idea was to bring logic into the way issues (or tickets) would
go through the flow. 

This was a challenging, yet very educational project for which I was the de
facto lead developer. With the start of the project, I decided on using NextJS
as the framework to be able to lean on its systems. Within this framework I used
Prisma for the database, this allowed me to write shared interfaces that would
be used for both the frontend and the database. 
To query said database, I chose to use GraphQL to only fetch what I needed,
where I needed it.
