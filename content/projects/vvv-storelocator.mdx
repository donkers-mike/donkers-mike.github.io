### Tech stack:
___
######  <IconBrandVue /> [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
Used for the entire front-end of the application 
######  <Image width="20" height="20" src="/magento-2-logo.svg" alt="magento 2 logo" /> [Magento](https://business.adobe.com/nl/products/magento/magento-commerce.html)
Magento is the framework the Vue application was injected into.

### My Responsibilities
___
My responsibilities within this project were fully focused on expanding,
maintaining and building new features within the Vue application.
<br />
To properly do my job within these responsibilities I used the following tech;
######  <IconBrandVue /> [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
###### <IconBrandSass /> [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Challenges
___
One of the biggest challenges within this projects was, to me, the API and how
the data we needed was supplied. The way this was set up did not make sense to
me and I felt like we had to jump through far too many hoops to get our features
built.

One example I doubt I'll ever forget is that the only way (at the time) to get
certain data to be properly parsed was to nest 5 (yes, FIVE) foreach loops
within eachother, giving birth to this monstrosity of code;
<br/>
```
stem.forEach(function(branch, i) {
	branch.forEach(function(twig, j) {
		twig.forEach(function(petiole, k) {
			petiole.forEach(function(leaf, x) {
				leaf.nodes.forEach(function(node, y) {
					// we're finally at all the data nodes
				})	
			})
		})
	})
})
```
<br/>
Sadly, it wasn't only in the very last loop that we needed to do things, we also
needed to either grab data or do something with data from the higher-level
loops. 

This meant we had to keep a very close eye on performance as this could very
easily get out of hand.
