### My Responsibilities
___
My Responsibilities within this project were limited to the React front-end, here I mostly worked on all the functionalities of said front-end as well as core functionalities of the configurator.

### Challenges
___
Within this project, the biggest challenge was getting what was visible in the configurator to perfectly reflect the end result. We had quite a few issues with this when it came to converting sizes from the actual result to the configurator and vice-versa. We eventually got to a point where we had an error margin that was on the same level as the manufacturing error margin.
